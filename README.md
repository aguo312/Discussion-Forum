# Discussion-Forum

Project based on my previous QA Forum project using Spring Boot as the server instead.

## Client Dependencies

- Axios

## Server Dependencies

- Spring Boot Starter Data MongoDB
- Spring Boot Starter Web

## Startup

On VSCode run the file `DiscussionForumApplication.java` from the server directory

On a command line, go to the client directory and use the command `npm run dev`

## Current Goals

- Profile page of posts and comments
- Edit a question's text
- Return to Datatable on refresh instead of login screen
- Fix logout
- Fix Question being called twice at data table
- Resolvetoken method for conditional rendering the start page depending on if you are logged in

## Future Features

- Persistent login for a set amount of time
