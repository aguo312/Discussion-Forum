# Discussion-Forum

Project based on my previous QA Forum project using Spring Boot as the server instead.

## Client Dependencies

- Axios

## Server Dependencies

- Spring Boot Starter Data MongoDB
- Spring Boot Starter Web
- Spring Boot Starter Security
- jjwt-api
- jjwt-impl
- jjwt-jackson

## Startup

On VSCode run the file `DiscussionForumApplication.java` from the server directory

On a command line, go to the client directory and use the command `npm run dev`

## Current Goals

- Edit a question's text
- Fix Register and Login immediately
- Guest Functions
