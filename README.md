# Discussion-Forum

Project based on my previous QA Forum project using Spring Boot as the server instead.

## Client Dependencies

- Axios

## Server Dependencies

- Spring Boot Starter Data MongoDB
- Spring Boot Starter Web

## Startup

On VSCode run the file `DiscussionForumApplication.java` from the server directory

On a command line, go to the client directory and use the command `npm run dev`

## Current Goals

- Posting an answer to a question
- Posting a comment to a question or answer
- Edit a question's text
- Profile page of posts and comments

## Future Features

(still learning how to implement these)

- Storing encrypted password into the database instead of the plaintext password
- Persistent login for a set amount of time
